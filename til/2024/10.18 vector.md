# Vector

Vector in C++ is like a dynamic array. It contains elements of the same type of data, and can be accessed by indexing.

The size can grow as more data are pushed back.

- Declaration & Initiation

    ```cpp
    std::vector<std::string> groceryList = {"haagen daz Coffee", "haagen daz Strawberry", "haagen daz Chocolate"};

    // you can do it this way
    std::vector<std::string> groceryList;
    groceryList.push_back("haagen daz Coffee");
    groceryList.push_back("haagen daz Strawberry");
    groceryList.push_back("haagen daz Chocolate");
    ```

- Adding element

    ```cpp
    groceryList.push_back("haagen daz Mint Choco");
    ```

- Loop

    Besides looping with iterator, we can also use range-base loop.
    
    ```cpp
    for (std::string el: groceryList) {
        std::cout << el << "\n";
    }
    ```

    When we want to change element,

    ```cpp
    std::vector<string> anotherGroceryList = {"Soy Sauce", "Hondashi", "Brown Rice"};
    int i = 0;
    for (std::string& el: groceryList) {
        el = anotherGroceryList[i++];
    }
    ```
