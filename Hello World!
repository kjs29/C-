#include<iostream>

using namespace std;//means that  we can use names for objects and variables from standard library

int main () {
	cout << "Hello World!"; //cout is pronounced as 'see-out', used together with insertion operator << to output/print text.
	return 0; //return 0; ends the main function.
}

//The code above can be written like this.

#include <iostream>
int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello World!"; //instead of 'using namespace std' we can also use std followed by :: operator
	return 0;
}
