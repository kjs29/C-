The endl manipulator produces a newline character, exactly as the insertion of '\n' does; 
but it also has an additional behavior: 
the stream's buffer (if any) is flushed, which means that the output is requested to be physically written to the device, 
if it wasn't already. This affects mainly fully buffered streams, and cout is (generally) not a fully buffered stream. 
Still, it is generally a good idea to use endl only when flushing the stream would be a feature and '\n' when it would not. 
Bear in mind that a flushing operation incurs a certain overhead, and on some devices it may produce a delay.


what is a buffer? and what is 'flushing'?
